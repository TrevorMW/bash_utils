  Initialization script for dw_ba_core cartridge

  Usage: ./init [command, [subcommand]] [flags]

  Commands:

    module                     For mangaing modules. Without any arguements, it just lists the modules currently in the repo.

    module add [url] [flags]

    setup                      Clears repo of unwanted files, checks out latest submodule version,
                               merges all cartridges and metadata, then zips metadata. This is the main command
                               needed to create the final dw_ba_core module.

    setup dev                  Resets the cartridge, and rebuilds it with all the available modules.

    setup production           Resets the cartridge, and rebuilds it with whitelisted modules.

    update                     Updates all submodules registered and located in ./modules

    copy                       Merges the meta, cartridge, and tools data in /modules/* into /dw_ba_core/cartridge.
                               This builds the bundled DWRE cartridge

    zipmeta                    Merges all the metadata located in all modules into /dw_ba_core/sites and zips it up into an importable file

    reset                      Resets the module to its original state (for development & testing purposes)
